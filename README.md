# Tidal Cheat Sheet

## Contains

The cheat sheet as a pdf and the tex file for generating the cheat sheet.

It also containts a small python script for collecting a list of samples within any folder. I used this to collect the name of all superdirt samples.

## Purpose

The goal of this cheatsheet is to:

1. _Provide a quick reference for Tidalists when they need a refresher._

1. _Allow Tidalists to not get too stagnant in their playing._ It's easy to keep repeating the old patterns. Glancing at the cheatsheet reveals a lot of options, many which are probably outside one's usual fallback options.

## Acknowledgements

The design is based off a [Stack Exchange answer](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/8827/preparing-cheat-sheets) which is in turn based off Winston Chang's [latexsheet](https://github.com/wch/latexsheet). My singular contribution to the design has been to include `\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}` which makes the font more Haskell friendly.
