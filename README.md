# Tidal Cheat Sheet

## Purpose

The goal of this cheatsheet is to:

1. Provide a quick reference for Tidalists when they need a refresher.

1. Allow Tidalists to not get too stolid in their playing. It's easy to keep repeating the old patterns. Glancing at the cheatsheet reveals a lot of options, many which are probably outside one's usual fallback options.

## Acknowledgements

The design is based off a [Stack Exchange answer](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/8827/preparing-cheat-sheets) which is in turn based off Winston Chang's [latexsheet](https://github.com/wch/latexsheet). My singular contribution to the design has been to include `\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}` which makes the font more Haskell friendly.
